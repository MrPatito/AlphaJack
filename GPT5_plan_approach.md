deeply analyze this ML model repository and give me feedback about the archytecture, execution and everything to help me improve my project accuracy. then, if the development state is on rigth tracks execute a first training run to test following steps on the behaibour. 
Disclaimer: i think hardware resources used by neural network are not optimal due to the GPU in the training run seems to be unactive. I got a RTX 3050 6Gb laptop. so i guess is more efective or effitient to use GPU instead of CPU. If where posible i'd like to use every component for instance GPU and CPU tandem configuration (I think this isn't prioritary at this development instance).
have you any questions about my requeriments?

Thanks — I reviewed your AlphaJack repo in depth and I do have a few clarifying questions. First, here’s a focused analysis of the architecture, training/execution, and specific steps to improve both accuracy and GPU utilization on your RTX 3050.

Architecture and design
- Overall structure: Clear, modular AlphaZero-style design with:
  - BlackjackEnvironment (game logic/state),
  - NeuralNetwork (policy+value heads),
  - MCTS (guidance/search),
  - Trainer (self-play + supervised updates).
- State representation: Compact (10-dim) and includes strategic features (soft flag, up-card, running count, deck penetration, action-availability flags). This is a solid starting point.
- Action space: 4 discrete actions (Hit, Stand, Double, Split). Legal action masking happens before sampling — good.
- NN model: 3 shared FC layers with BN and Dropout, then linear policy/value heads.
  - Concern: BatchNorm1d with small batches can introduce instability, particularly if batch_size < 16 or variable batch composition. You already set eval() in demos/tests to avoid BN issues, which is good. During training with batch_size=32 it’s fine, but see suggestions below.
- MCTS:
  - Selection: UCT with prior from NN and visit counts.
  - Expansion/Eval: Uses NN outputs at leaf (good).
  - Backup: Currently flips sign at each parent.backup(-value). This is standard for alternating-turn games. In Blackjack as modeled here, only the player chooses actions; the dealer’s play is deterministic and internal to the environment. Because there is no true opponent turn choosing from the tree, the sign flip likely introduces bias. You should not negate value during backup in a single-agent episodic setting (see “MCTS correctness” below).
  - Root exploration: No Dirichlet noise at the root; could harm exploration early.

Training/execution flow
- Self-play data is collected per-iteration and trained end-to-end each iteration. You define a replay buffer but never use it to sample across iterations (training_buffer is created but unused). This leads to higher variance and potential forgetting. Consider experience replay across multiple recent iterations.
- Losses: Cross-entropy on policy, MSE on value. Reasonable.
- Evaluation: Uses MCTS with temperature=0 for deterministic choices. Good.
- Checkpoints: Saved every 10 iterations, and final_model.pth saved in train mode. performance_analysis.py expects ‘training_stats’ in checkpoints — consistent with training.py.

Performance and accuracy improvement opportunities
1) MCTS correctness and stability
- Remove sign flip in backup:
  - In MCTSNode.backup you do parent.backup(-value). In single-agent settings (player-only actions), this is incorrect. Value should be propagated without negation because the agent’s perspective does not alternate. This fix can significantly improve the learning signal.
  - Proposed change: self.parent.backup(value) instead of -value.
- Root exploration:
  - Add Dirichlet noise to root priors to improve early exploration (e.g., α=0.3 for 4 actions, ε=0.25 mixing).
- Temperature schedule:
  - You decay from 1.0 to 0.1 linearly via iteration; consider a two-phase schedule per move count (high T for first N moves per game, low after) or a longer warmup.
- Simulation count scaling:
  - MCTS simulations default to 100. For initial smoke tests keep small (e.g., 25–50), then increase later as GPU utilization improves. Consider c_param tuning.

2) GPU utilization and efficiency
- Current code never moves the model or tensors to CUDA. That’s why your GPU is idle.
  - Add device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
  - Move model: self.neural_net.to(device)
  - Move tensors in training and inference:
    - states, action_probs, outcomes = tensors.to(device)
    - In MCTS expand/eval and validate paths, ensure inputs are sent to device and outputs .cpu() only for numpy ops.
- Mixed precision:
  - Use torch.cuda.amp.autocast() and GradScaler for training to increase throughput on RTX 3050 and fit larger batches.
- DataLoader performance:
  - In training, set pin_memory=True and non_blocking=True on .to(device) copies.
  - num_workers: Start with 2–4 and tune.
- Optional: cap CPU threads to reduce CPU contention: torch.set_num_threads(k) if CPU is saturating.

3) NN architecture
- BatchNorm vs LayerNorm:
  - If you observe batch_size dips or instability, replace BN with LayerNorm or GroupNorm. BN in small-batch regimes often degrades signal. Alternatively, keep BN but ensure batch_size >= 32 consistently.
- Regularization:
  - You already use dropout=0.2; reasonable. Consider weight decay (e.g., 1e-4) in Adam.
- Capacity:
  - 256-256-128 is reasonable for your 10-dim input. If underfitting, modestly increase width (e.g., 512) once GPU is used. If overfitting, reduce or add stronger regularization.

4) Training data and learning dynamics
- Experience replay:
  - Use the defined deque buffer to retain data across iterations (e.g., last 10–20 iterations). Sample mini-batches uniformly or with prioritization.
- Entropy regularization:
  - Early training can benefit from an entropy bonus added to the policy loss to encourage exploration; you already compute entropy — consider adding λ * entropy to total loss in early iterations (λ ~ 0.01–0.05).
- Temperature control per stage:
  - Consider higher temperatures early in each game for exploration and anneal within-episode.
- Evaluation consistency:
  - Use a fixed random seed for eval to reduce variance in metrics.

5) Environment/game logic
- Rule fidelity:
  - verify_blackjack_rules.py is thorough and passes assertions — good.
  - Dealer rules: Stands on 17+ by your implementation; many casinos stand on soft 17 or hit on soft 17 (H17). You can add a flag for H17 vs S17 to test robustness and configure training targets.
- Reward shaping:
  - Rewards normalized by a max possible of 3.0 (2 hands x 1.5). That’s okay. Just note your value head targets lie in [-1, 1] and include effect of doubling and split frequency.
- Split handling:
  - Single split allowed, no re-splits — consistent with many casinos. If you plan to add resplit up to N, add to state vector.

6) Code quality and small issues
- MCTS._simulate terminal handling:
  - When current.children is empty (terminal), you try env.step(Action.STAND) to read final reward. That mutates env after terminal. Better: query an accessor for terminal reward if available or ensure step(Action.STAND) is a no-op at terminal. It currently works because you guard earlier, but it’s brittle.
- Training buffer not used:
  - training_buffer deque is never populated or sampled from; either remove or implement replay.
- Logging/metrics:
  - You list tensorboard in requirements but don’t log to it. Adding TB summaries (losses, entropy, win/loss/push rates, avg reward, temperatures) will help tracking and diagnosing regressions.
- Seeding:
  - Add a seed utility (random, numpy, torch.cuda/manual_seed_all) for reproducibility.

What to change for GPU activation (high level)
- Add device selection in AlphaJackTrainer.__init__ and store self.device.
- Move model to device.
- In training:
  - Wrap forward/backward with autocast if device is cuda.
  - Use GradScaler for optimizer step.
  - Move states/action_probs/outcomes to device before forward.
- In MCTS expand:
  - Ensure state tensor is on the same device as the model. Use with torch.no_grad(), state_tensor = state_tensor.to(device).
- In demo/eval/validate paths:
  - Move model to device; use with torch.no_grad() and device tensors.

Example minimal patches (descriptive, not executing)
- training.py:
  - In __init__: self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"); self.neural_net.to(self.device)
  - In train_network:
    - states = states.to(self.device); action_probs = action_probs.to(self.device); outcomes = outcomes.to(self.device)
    - Use torch.cuda.amp.autocast() and GradScaler around forward/backward if CUDA.
- mcts.py:
  - In expand(): state_tensor = state_tensor.to(device_of_model)
  - Keep outputs on device; when converting to numpy for probabilities, use .detach().cpu().numpy()
- main.py:
  - Trainer already encapsulates the model; no changes needed besides ensuring CUDA logic is inside trainer.

First smoke training run proposal
- Purpose: Verify end-to-end flow, GPU utilization, memory fit, logging.
- Suggested parameters:
  - iterations: 1
  - games_per_iteration: 50
  - epochs_per_iteration: 2
  - simulations: 25
  - batch_size: 64 (try 64 with AMP on 6GB VRAM; fall back to 32 if OOM)
  - learning_rate: 1e-3
  - seed: fixed (e.g., 42)
- Command (once GPU support is added):
  - python main.py --mode train --iterations 1 --games_per_iteration 50 --epochs_per_iteration 2 --simulations 25 --batch_size 64 --learning_rate 0.001
- Validation: run nvidia-smi to confirm utilization; Torch should report cuda available.

Open questions to clarify before I produce the execution plan
1) Environment and CUDA
- Can we confirm CUDA availability and driver/toolkit with:
  - nvidia-smi
  - python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else None)"
- Are you using a virtualenv/conda environment for this project? If yes, which Python and PyTorch versions are installed?
- Do you want me to target system-level CUDA or use the PyTorch CUDA wheels that bundle CUDA? (Your requirements has unpinned torch; we may need a specific torch+cuda version compatible with 3050.)

2) Code modifications
- Are you okay with me proposing concrete changes to:
  - Remove the sign flip in MCTS backup for Blackjack (single-agent).
  - Add CUDA device management and optional AMP.
  - Implement experience replay (use your deque) sampling across the last N iterations.
  - Add TensorBoard logging.
- Do you prefer minimal patches first (GPU + backup fix) and hold off on replay/logging, or include all at once?

3) Training budget and targets
- For the initial GPU-enabled smoke test, do you have time limits or resource constraints?
- What metric is your primary success criterion for “on the right track”? (e.g., trending down loss, eval avg_reward > -0.05 after X iterations, or win_rate > 40% in eval)

4) Rule variants
- Do you want the environment to support H17 vs S17 as a toggle? It affects strategy and final achievable EV slightly.

5) Logging and artifacts
- Where should checkpoints and logs be saved? Defaults are local project root; we can create a runs/ directory with date-stamped folders.

Next steps
- Once you answer the questions, I will:
  - Refine the exact task description to include your preferences.
  - Provide a precise, safe terminal execution plan for:
    - Verifying CUDA.
    - Installing the correct torch build.
    - Applying the minimal code changes.
    - Running the smoke training and verifying GPU usage.
    - Saving artifacts and optionally launching TensorBoard.

Let me know your answers to the questions above and any constraints/preferences, and I’ll prepare the final, step-by-step execution plan.
