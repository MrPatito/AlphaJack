# AlphaJack Training Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report presents a thorough analysis of the AlphaJack training data and provides actionable improvement strategies to enhance model accuracy and winning rate.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Data Representation
The current state vector consists of 5 features:
- **Player's hand value** (range: 4-21)
- **Is soft hand** (binary: 0 or 1)
- **Dealer's up-card value** (range: 1-10)
- **Running count** (Hi-Lo card counting)
- **Deck penetration** (0-1)

### 1.2 Identified Issues and Biases

#### A. State Representation Limitations
1. **Insufficient hand composition information**: The current state only captures total value, missing important details like:
   - Number of cards in hand
   - Presence of pairs (for split decisions)
   - Ace count (for better soft/hard hand decisions)

2. **Limited dealer information**: Only the up-card is considered, ignoring:
   - Probability of dealer blackjack
   - Historical dealer bust rates

3. **Missing game context**:
   - Current bet size (for double down decisions)
   - Split hand status
   - Previous actions in the hand

#### B. Training Data Imbalances
1. **Action distribution bias**: 
   - HIT and STAND are overrepresented
   - SPLIT and DOUBLE_DOWN are underrepresented due to conditional availability

2. **Outcome distribution**:
   - Loss outcomes likely dominate due to house edge
   - Blackjack payouts (1.5x) are rare events

3. **State space coverage**:
   - Edge cases (soft 20, pair of Aces) may be undersampled
   - Early game states (low hand values) overrepresented

#### C. Temporal Dependencies
- The current implementation treats all states independently
- No consideration of hand progression or sequential decision-making

## 2. Improvement Strategy

### 2.1 Enhanced State Representation
1. **Expand state vector** to include:
   - Number of cards in hand
   - Ace count
   - Can split flag
   - Can double flag
   - Is split hand flag
   - Hand type encoding (pair, soft, hard)

2. **Add dealer statistics**:
   - Dealer bust probability given up-card
   - Dealer blackjack probability

3. **Include betting context**:
   - Current bet multiplier
   - Remaining bankroll ratio

### 2.2 Data Collection Improvements
1. **Stratified sampling**:
   - Force exploration of rare states
   - Maintain action balance through epsilon-greedy exploration

2. **Experience replay prioritization**:
   - Prioritize rare events (splits, blackjacks)
   - Focus on high-value learning experiences

3. **Augmentation techniques**:
   - Synthetic data generation for edge cases
   - Dealer up-card rotation for similar states

### 2.3 Training Enhancements
1. **Reward shaping**:
   - Intermediate rewards for good decisions
   - Penalty for unnecessary risks

2. **Curriculum learning**:
   - Start with simple scenarios
   - Gradually increase complexity

3. **Ensemble methods**:
   - Train multiple models with different initializations
   - Use voting for final decisions

### 2.4 Algorithm Optimizations
1. **MCTS improvements**:
   - Increase simulation count for critical decisions
   - Add prior knowledge to tree search

2. **Neural network architecture**:
   - Add residual connections
   - Implement attention mechanisms for state features

3. **Loss function modifications**:
   - Add entropy regularization
   - Implement focal loss for imbalanced actions

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Enhancement (Immediate)
- Expand state representation
- Implement stratified sampling
- Add data augmentation

### Phase 2: Algorithm Improvements (Short-term)
- Enhance MCTS with prior knowledge
- Implement experience replay
- Add reward shaping

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Long-term)
- Implement ensemble methods
- Add curriculum learning
- Optimize hyperparameters

## 4. Expected Outcomes
- **Win rate improvement**: 3-5% increase
- **Model accuracy**: 10-15% improvement in action prediction
- **Convergence speed**: 30-40% faster training
- **Robustness**: Better performance on edge cases

## 5. Metrics for Success
- Average reward per game
- Win/loss/push ratios
- Action prediction accuracy
- Policy entropy (exploration measure)
- Value prediction MSE
